## 🧠 AI Model Architecture & Flow

### **1. Input Processing Pipeline**

```
User Message → Crisis Detection → Context Analysis → Therapeutic Analysis → Response Generation
```

#### **Step 1: Crisis Detection System**
```javascript
// Location: ChatbotScreen.js - detectCrisisSituation()
KEYWORDS MONITORED:
- Suicide: "kill myself", "want to die", "end my life"
- Self-harm: "cut myself", "hurt myself", "deserve pain"
- Severe Depression: "no hope", "can't go on", "unbearable"

CRISIS LEVELS:
- Immediate: Suicide/self-harm keywords → Emergency protocols
- High: Self-harm indicators → Professional referral
- Moderate: Severe hopelessness → Support resources
```

#### **Step 2: Conversation Context Analysis**
```javascript
// Location: ChatbotScreen.js - analyzeConversationContinuity()
CONTEXT TRACKING:
- Previous conversation topics
- Emotional continuity
- Reference detection ("her", "she", "my situation")
- New aspects of same topic
```

#### **Step 3: Therapeutic Content Analysis**
```javascript
// Location: ChatbotScreen.js - analyzeAsTherapist()
CONTENT ANALYSIS:
- Relationship patterns: breakup, unrequited love, rejection
- Emotional indicators: pain level, timeframes, specific concerns
- Therapeutic needs: grief processing, reality testing, acceptance
```

### **2. AI Response Generation System**

#### **Multi-Layer Response Engine**
```javascript
LAYER 1: Crisis Response (if detected)
├── Immediate: Emergency contacts + crisis resources
├── High: Professional referral + location-based support
└── Moderate: Self-care guidance + support resources

LAYER 2: Contextual Continuation (if ongoing conversation)
├── Relationship regret continuation
├── Alternative reality thinking responses
└── Emotional processing continuation

LAYER 3: Therapeutic Analysis Response
├── Relationship loss processing
├── Moving on difficulties
├── Self-worth and identity issues
└── General emotional support

LAYER 4: Intelligent Fallback
└── Universal contextual understanding for any unseen statement
```

- Base intensity: 0.5
- Amplifiers: "really", "very", "extremely" (+0.2)
- Strong words: "devastating", "overwhelming" (+0.3)
- Caps and exclamation marks: Additional intensity
```

### **Mood Tracking Integration**

MOOD DATA STRUCTURE:
{
  userId: string,
  emotionName: string,

## 💬 Conversation Flow Examples

### **Example 1: Initial Heartbreak**
```
USER: "For 2 years I loved her one side and then i proposed to her and she said okay but after one week she said let's break up and now i cant forget her"

AI PROCESSING:
1. Crisis Detection: None detected
2. Context Analysis: New conversation topic
3. Therapeutic Analysis: 
   - Situation: relationship_loss
   - Issues: confusing_mixed_signals, unrequited_love
   - Timeframe: 2_years
   - Pain Level: high

AI RESPONSE: 
"💙 I can really hear the pain and confusion in what you've shared. What you experienced - having someone say 'okay' to your proposal and then ending things a week later - that kind of mixed signal is incredibly confusing and hurtful..."
```

### **Example 2: Conversation Continuation**
```
USER: "See i feel like if i didn't propose to her my life would be nice"

AI PROCESSING:
1. Crisis Detection: None detected
2. Context Analysis: 
   - Continues previous conversation ✓
   - References same person ("her") ✓
   - New aspect: regret/what-if thinking
3. Therapeutic Analysis: relationship_regret_continuation

AI RESPONSE:
"💛 I hear you having regrets about proposing to her, and wondering if you'd be in a different - perhaps less painful - place if you hadn't taken that step. That kind of 'what if' thinking is so common when we're processing heartbreak..."
```
