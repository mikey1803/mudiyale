## 🧠 AI System Details

### Custom NLP Engine

Kintsugi uses a sophisticated **rule-based Natural Language Processing** system instead of external AI APIs for several reasons:

**Advantages:**
- ⚡ **Speed**: 500ms response time vs 5-10 seconds with external APIs
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Data never leaves your control
- 💰 **Cost**: No per-request API fees
- 🎯 **Control**: Complete customization of therapeutic responses
- 📶 **Reliability**: No dependency on external services

### Emotion Detection Algorithm

**3-Tier Keyword System:**
- **Primary Keywords** (Weight: 1.0): Strongest emotional indicators
  - Sad: "devastated", "heartbroken", "depressed"
  - Anxious: "panic", "terrified", "anxiety"
  - Angry: "furious", "enraged", "livid"
  
- **Secondary Keywords** (Weight: 0.8): Moderate indicators
  - Sad: "down", "blue", "melancholy"
  - Anxious: "worried", "nervous", "scared"
  
- **Contextual Keywords** (Weight: 0.6): Subtle indicators
  - Sad: "crying", "tears", "empty", "alone"
  - Anxious: "racing thoughts", "can't sleep"

### Intensity Calculation

```javascript
Base Intensity: 0.5
+ Amplifiers (+0.2): "really", "extremely", "so", "very"
+ Strong Words (+0.3): "devastating", "overwhelming"
+ Caps (+0.1): UPPERCASE text
+ Exclamations (+0.1): Each "!"
- Diminishers (-0.2): "a bit", "slightly", "maybe"
= Final Intensity (0.0 - 1.0)
```

### Response Quality Levels

- **High Intensity (0.8-1.0)**: Crisis/deep therapeutic support
- **Medium Intensity (0.5-0.7)**: Balanced empathetic guidance
- **Low Intensity (0.0-0.4)**: Gentle acknowledgment and check-in
