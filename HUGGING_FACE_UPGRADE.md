# 🚀 ADVANCED AI UPGRADE: Hugging Face Integration

## 🌟 **WHAT YOU NOW HAVE:**

Your Kintsugi chatbot now has **TWO AI SYSTEMS**:

1. **🤗 Advanced Hugging Face AI** (Primary)
   - Uses professional therapy models
   - More sophisticated natural language understanding
   - Better conversation flow and context awareness
   - Advanced emotion detection and response

2. **⚡ Local Kintsugi AI** (Backup)
   - Your original system as a reliable fallback
   - Ensures the app always works even if API fails
   - Handles crisis detection locally for safety

## 🔧 **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:**

### **Step 1: Get Hugging Face Token**
1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Sign up/Login
3. Go to Settings → Access Tokens
4. Create a new token with "Read" permissions
5. Copy your token (starts with `hf_`)

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variable**
1. Create `.env.local` file in your project root:
```bash
HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
```

2. Or export in your terminal:

export HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
```

### **Step 3: Install Required Dependencies**

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS:**

```
User Message → Crisis Check → Hugging Face API → Therapeutic Response
                     ↓
