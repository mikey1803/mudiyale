# ðŸŽµ How to Add Your Custom Playlists

## Quick Setup Guide

Since you want to add your own curated playlists for each mood, here's the easiest way:

### Step 1: Update the ChatbotScreen.js file

In your `screens/ChatbotScreen.js` file, around **line 122-156**, you'll see this section with placeholder playlist URLs:

```javascript
const moodPlaylists = {
  'sad': {
    name: 'Healing Hearts',
    description: 'Gentle music to help process sadness and find comfort ðŸ’™',
    url: 'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX7qK8ma5wgG1' // Replace with your sad playlist
  },
  'happy': {
    name: 'Pure Joy', 
    description: 'Uplifting tracks to amplify your happiness âœ¨',
    url: 'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0XUsuxWHRQd' // Replace with your happy playlist
  },
  // ... etc
};
```

### Step 2: Get Your Spotify Playlist Links

1. Open Spotify (app or web)
2. Go to your playlist
3. Click the **three dots (...)** menu
4. Select **Share** â†’ **Copy link to playlist**
5. You'll get a link like: `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J1K`

### Step 3: Replace the URLs

Simply replace each `url:` value with your own playlist links:

```javascript
'sad': {
  name: 'Your Sad Playlist Name',
  description: 'Your custom description ðŸ’™',
  url: 'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/YOUR_ACTUAL_PLAYLIST_ID'
},
```
