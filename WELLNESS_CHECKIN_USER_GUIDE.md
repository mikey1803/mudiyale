# 🎯 Wellness Check-In - Automatic Daily Flow

## 🌟 **How It Works**

When you first open the chatbot, it **automatically starts a wellness check-in** to understand how you're doing today!

---

## **The Flow**

### **Step 1: Welcome Message**
```
Kintsugi: Hey there! 💙 Welcome to Kintsugi AI. I'm here as your 
          companion and friend.
          
          Before we start, I'd love to check in with you...
```

### **Step 2: First Question (Auto-Appears)**
```
Kintsugi: How was your day today? 🌤️
          
          Just tell me in your own words - was it good, bad, 
          okay, or somewhere in between?
```

### **Step 3: Your Response Determines the Path**

---

## **🌟 Path 1: Good Day**

### **Your Response:**
```
You: "It was great!" 
You: "Really good"
You: "Amazing day"
You: "Pretty happy"
```

### **Chatbot Asks:**
```
Kintsugi: 🌟 That's wonderful to hear! I'm really happy for you.
          
          What made your day so good? Tell me what happened! 😊
```

### **You Share:**
```
You: "I got promoted at work!"
```

### **Chatbot Response:**
```
Kintsugi: 🌟 That's absolutely wonderful! It sounds like things went 
          really well at work today! Those moments of professional 
          success and recognition are so important to celebrate.
          
          💪 You worked hard for this, and you deserve to feel proud. 
          Career wins like this don't happen by accident - they happen 
          because of your dedication and effort.
          
          What does this success mean to you? How does it feel to be 
          recognized? 🌟
```

## **💙 Path 2: Difficult Day**

### **Your Response:**
```
You: "It was bad"
You: "Really rough day"
You: "Terrible"
You: "Had a hard time"
```

### **Chatbot Asks:**
```
Kintsugi: 💙 I'm sorry to hear you had a rough day. Thank you for 
          being honest with me.
          
          What happened that made it difficult? I'm here to listen. 🤗
```

### **You Share:**
```
You: "I had a fight with my boss and I feel terrible"
```

### **Chatbot Response (Work-Specific):**
```
Kintsugi: 💙 Thank you for trusting me with this. I can hear how much 
          this affected you today, and I want you to know that your 
          feelings are completely valid.
          
          **Work difficulties can be so draining.** When we spend so 
          much of our energy at work, conflicts or stress there can 
          affect everything else in our lives.
          
          💼 **Difficult boss dynamics are exhausting.** You deserve to 
          work in an environment where you feel respected and valued.
          
          **What might help:**
          ✨ **Set boundaries** - Your time and energy are valuable
          🌊 **Take real breaks** - Even 5 minutes can help
          💪 **Document everything** - Protect yourself
          🤗 **Talk to someone** - Don't carry this alone
          🎯 **Remember your worth** - Bad work situations don't define you
          
          What would feel most helpful for you right now?
```

---

## **🌸 Path 3: Neutral/Okay Day**

### **Your Response:**
```
You: "It was okay"
You: "Just average"
You: "Meh, nothing special"
```

### **Chatbot Asks:**
```
Kintsugi: 💙 I hear you - just an okay, average kind of day. 
          Sometimes that's how it is.
          
          Is there anything on your mind you'd like to talk about? 
          Or are you feeling pretty neutral? 🌸
```

### **If You Have Something to Share:**
```
You: "I guess I'm feeling a bit lonely lately"

Kintsugi: 💙 I hear you. It sounds like you're processing some things, 
          and I'm here to listen without judgment...
```

### **If Nothing Specific:**
```
You: "No, nothing really"

Kintsugi: 💙 That's totally okay! Sometimes we're just in a neutral space, 
          and that's completely valid. I'm here whenever you want to 
          talk about anything - big or small, serious or lighthearted. 🌸

### **Scenario 2: Having a Difficult Day**

```
You: check in

Kintsugi: 💙 Hey there! Let's do a quick wellness check-in together...
          How was your day today?

You: I'm feeling really anxious about my upcoming exams and can't focus

Kintsugi: 💙 Thank you for sharing that with me. I can hear how difficult this

          **Anxiety can be so overwhelming.** Here are some grounding techniques:
          
          🌊 **5-4-3-2-1 Method**: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you 
             hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
          💨 **Box Breathing**: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4
          🎯 **Name it**: Say 'I'm experiencing anxiety' instead of 'I am anxious' 
             - creates distance
          🌸 **Challenge catastrophic thoughts**: What's the evidence for/against 
             this fear?
          
          What's fueling the anxiety right now? Let's work through it together.
